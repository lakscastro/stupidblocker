A stupid **chrome** extension to avoid my `ctrl + t` procrastination sessions

Any hostname (google.com, twitter.com, etc.) added here will be block listed and then redirected to a gist I created when they are loaded into current tab

- Add a hostname in the pop-up input + button
- Remove a hostname by double clicking it
